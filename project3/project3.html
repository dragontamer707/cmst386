<div class="div1"><h2>The Importance of Responsive Design</h2>
			<p>Responsive design can be important for a number of reasons; some reasons including being able to optimize the site to be mobile friendly, adjusting to device sizes and even improving search engine ranks. Keeping your website responsive and optimized for different screen sizes can help increase the time people stay on your website. If they're forced to resize and scroll just so your website can be easily seen on their screen, they may be turned away from using your website, and will opt for another, similar, website. However, with responsive design, this process of resizing and scaling is done automatically, for the user. It also replaces the formerly necessary need to design a mobile dedicated website for mobile users. It allows for a lot of design flexibility and is user friendly, it improves satisfaction in your website visitors, and can help with SEO for being mobile-optimized.</p> </div>
<div class="div2"><h2>Google Analytics</h2>
			<p>Google Analytics provides data which can help access the successfulness of a website. Three reports that can help with this are:<br><br>
<b>1: Audience</b><br>
The Audience section tells you about the people who visit your website, and includes information such as location, age, gender, browsers, etc. It also provides data on how people found your website. You can see if they found you via search engine or social media traffic. <br><br>
<b>2: AdWords</b><br>
AdWords is a pay-per-click online advertising platform through Google, that allows advertisers to display their ads on Google search engine results. The AdWords Reports show you how many individuals have gotten to your website via AdWords links, and will help determine the successfulness of certain keywords. <br><br>
<b>3: All Pages Report</b><br>
The All Pages Report helps measure what content is working. Every week, you'll see a list displaying the top performing content, along with any revenue that page has earned. Pages with a high visitor rate can be clearly seen, and it'll be easy to see what pages people choose to leave quickly due to it not suiting what they want or need. </p>
