<div class="div1"><h2>Client Side vs Server Side Preprocessing</h2>
			<p>LESS, or Learner Style Sheets is a backwards compatible language extension for CSS. SASS, or Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets is a professional grade CSS extension language which offers more than other CSS extensions. When you run one of these extensions at either server or client side, the preprocessor can recognize and convert any file extensions as appropriate. Running server side requires you to install a package on your server, while client side, you only need to download a js file to include in your code. </p> </div>
<div class="div2"><h2>LESS Mechanisms</h2>
			<p>In this, I will be focusing on LESS, rather than SASS. LESS is an open-source language, and is a nested metalanguage. It can be run server or client side, or can be compiled into plain CSS. It allows real time compilation via LESS.js. LESS Provides the following mechanisms: <br><br>
<b>Variables</b> are allowed to be defined with the @ sign in Less. Variable assignment is completed with a colon :.
<br><b>Mixins</b> allow properties of one class to be embedded into another class by including the class name as one of the properties. They can also behave like functions and take arguments. CSS itself does not support Mixins, and any repeated code must be replicated in each section. This is one of the benefits of LESS, having to type less repeating code. <br>
<b>Nesting</b> is supported in CSS, but the code blocks themselves are not nested. However, with LESS, nesting is allowed to be inside of other selectors, making the style sheets shorter. <br>
<b>Functions</b> map pne to pne with JavaScript code, allowing manipulation of their values. While <b> Operations</b> allow addition, subtraction, division and multiplication of property values and colors. It can be used to create complex relationships between properties. <br><br>
LESS was designed after SASS. However, LESS was designed to be as close to CSS as possible, so standard CSS c ode can be used as valid LESS code. </p>
