			<h2>How Search Engines Work</h2>
			<p>A search engine works through three primary functions: crawling, indexing and ranking. <b>Crawling</b> is a discovery process. The search engine sends out crawlers or spiders to find new and updated content. <b>Indexing</b> is where the engine stores and processes information found in an index of all the content they deem good enough to give as search results. And <b>Ranking</b> is for when somebody performs a search. The search engine scours the index for a highly relevant result and then orders the content. The ordering is sorted by relevance known as ranking. The higher a website is ranked, the more relevant the search engine believes it is to the search query. </p>
		<h2>Importance of Keywords and Descriptions as Meta Tags</h2>
<p>There are three important parts of a meta tag. Title, Description and Keywords. The reason meta tags are important is that search engines read them in order to see if keywords and description are related to visible content. A meta tag is an element that describes and summarizes the content of a page for the benefit of search engines and users. </p>
<h2>Four Elements for Writing Relevant Content Links</h2>
<p>Assign alt text for images in HTML to give search engines a text description of the visual content, supplement search boxes with navigation and crawlable links, supplement flash or java plug-ins with text on the page and provide a transscript for video and audio content if the words and phrases used are meant to be indexed by search engines. </p>
<h2>What Constitutes Good Header Heirarchy</h2>
<p>Headers are important for structuring content, and including keywords in the headings can help boost your reach on saearch engines. <h3>Using subheaders to denote different places in your webpage can help structure your page, and make it easier for people to find the content they're here for.</h3> You don't want to skip a level in the heading heirarchy, don't go from <h1>H1</h1> to <h3>H3.</h3> H1 is used primarily for the page's main topic heading. H2 and onward are to further structure the content. They also help search engine algorithms. </p>
